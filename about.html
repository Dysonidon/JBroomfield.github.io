			<p>This is my about page for my website project</p>
			
			<h2>About the project</h2>
			<p>This webpage development project has been a great learning experience for me. I have developed a basic knowledge of CSS and programming using JavaScript.  I First discovered my enjoyment for programming when I taught myself to solve the Rubix cube in the summer of 2020. This was my introduction to problem solving through abstraction and would go onto developing code to solve programs in the same algorithmic fashion. I have set up this webpage to publicly display some of my own personal projects to discuss my thought process and share my love for programming and problem solving with anyone who I can refer to this page. Fell free to test out and program my own projects for yourself and if you have any questions or want to contact me, feel free to send me an email.</p>
